Models can write [competetive](https://x.com/marksaroufim/status/2009497284418130202?s=20) kernels now. But reward hacking is a bigger problem now than one could imagine. Some really good examples of reward hacking. 

(It's definitely not a kernel-writing specific problem though (?) Models are obviously reward hacking in the wild, it's just not getting the same scrutiny.)


Hints at what [Core Automation](https://www.coreauto.com/) is doing. Some inspirations from Adversarial training, although a *clarification* at end that they're still using transformers. 

- [x] [The Second Half - Shunyu Yao - 姚顺雨](https://ysymyth.github.io/The-Second-Half/) *


Why RL didn't work before? Why RL works now? ***Priors***.  
Scaling language pre-training gave us powerful priors. Yao mentions how this* may seem counterintutive to a classic RL researcher even just few years ago. (whole *miracle* was empirical anyway)

**language reasoning as actions*

AI's first half involved search for novel methods to hillclimb harder and harder benchmarks. Now The "recipe" is in place and is scaling well *so far*.  
But "*If novel methods are no longer needed and harder benchmarks will just get solved increasingly soon, what should we do?*"

> The second half of AI will shift focus from solving problems to defining problems. In this new era, evaluation becomes more important than training.


- [x] [Scaling Laws, Honestly | Diogo Almeida](https://x.com/CompleteSkeptic/status/2073442518117884197)

Kaplan et al. trained all models on the fixed amount of data (~130B tokens) and used a learning rate schedule that zeroes. Former caused big models to not get enough data and later caused models to not train enough.

[2406.12907](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12907), which tries to reconcile difference in results of two scaling lawa papers, is also inaccurate.


Labs' equity vortex drying academia, closed research and not acknowledging wrong results... is a sad state of affairs.

- [x] [LSA LongCat Sparse Attention - arjunkocher](https://www.k-a.in/LSA.html)

The indexer becomes the bottleneck in sparse attention; Meituan LSA focuses on this bottleneck and introduces three **orthogonal** optimizations to indexer.

TL;DR Distillation gives a better training signal than hard labels.
> ... line between distillation, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning and synthetic data is getting blurry.
